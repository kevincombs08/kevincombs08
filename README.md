### Hi there! 👋

My name is Kevin, thanks for stopping by. Just a quick few words:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a number of SQL, Python, R, & Tableau projects to round out my portfolio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning & crafting projects with R.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a media buyer that uses data analysis daily, so why not level up with some Python/R?

Databases - PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, Excel

Python: NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib (JupyterLab Notebook)

Viz: Tableau, Looker/GDS

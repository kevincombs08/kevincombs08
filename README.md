### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kevin, thanks for stopping by. Just a quick few words:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a number of SQL, Python, & Tableau projects to round out my portfolio.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python & R.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a media buyer that uses data analysis daily, so why not level up with some SQL/Python?

Databases - PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, Excel

Python: NumPy, Pandas (JupyterLab Notebook)

Viz: Tableau, Looker/GDS
